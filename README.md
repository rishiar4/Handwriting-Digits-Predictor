Handwriting Digits Prediction Model

This repository has the code for handwriting digits recognizer, it is one of the most popular projects for deep learning.
I have worked upon the same using Keras. Keras is a open source neural network library which uses libraries like Tensorflow and Thaeno as backend. It is a high level library made to enable speed execution of neural networks. 
In this I have worked with python and it helps to recognize hand written digits using Sequential model.

Libraries Used: 
  - Keras ( tensorflow as backend )
  - Matplotlib 
  - numpy 

Data has been taken from keras datasets.

Explanation:
  1. Loading the Libraries.
  2. Loading the data.
  3. Analysing the data.
  4. Reading the data and using matplotlib to plot the figures.

  5. Using Sequential model and adding the layers to the network.
  6. Summary of the network is observed.

  7. The Data is evaluated.
  8. The Predicted Model is then Evaluated.
  
Here we have used ANN to implement Digits Recognizer. We can use this to make our system understand our handwritten digits.
